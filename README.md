# movies-UIKit

This repository showcases a simple demonstration featuring a screen that presents a collection of movies and the movie detail screen. The demo also allows you to save your favorite movies. For this purpose, the following technologies have been used:

* UIKit
* MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
* Clean architecture
* Combine framework
* CoreData

Note: The example uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API (https://www.themoviedb.org). To run the example, you need to register to obtain the necessary information:

* API Key
* API Read Access Token

and add them to the ApiDetails class.
